## Project Definition

Reimburse Desk is a comprehensive enterprise expense management system designed to streamline the process of submitting, tracking, and approving business expenses. The application provides an intuitive interface for employees to submit expense claims with receipt documentation, while offering managers and finance teams powerful tools for review, analysis, and processing of reimbursements.

## Problem Statement

Traditional expense reimbursement processes face several challenges:

1. **Time-consuming manual workflows**: Paper-based or basic digital solutions require significant manual data entry.
2. **Lack of transparency**: Employees often have no visibility into the status of their reimbursement requests.
3. **Complex approval chains**: Multi-level approvals can delay reimbursements and frustrate employees.
4. **Receipt management**: Physical receipts can be lost, while digital receipts are often scattered across email and various platforms.
5. **Limited data analytics**: Finance teams lack tools to analyze spending patterns and enforce policy compliance.
6. **Integration challenges**: Many solutions don't integrate well with existing enterprise systems (accounting, HR, etc.).
